## CIFAR-10 TorchVision 

This directory provides the examples for computer vision tasks using PyTorch and torchvision with the CIFAR-10 dataset. The tutorial demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow from training to hyperparameter optimization and inference.

CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely-used benchmark consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes. It covers the en
tire machine learning workflow with PyTorch:

- **Training** - Implementing and training various model architectures
- **Hyperparameter Optimization** - Finding optimal hyperparameters using systematic sweeps
- **Inference** - Running trained models on new data and evaluating performance
